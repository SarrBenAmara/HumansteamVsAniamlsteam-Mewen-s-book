He poured his creativity into both          writing and illustrating this story, which beautifully explores the themes of Living         Things and Sport Aim. Mewen's work showcases not only his imagination but also                                             his dedication to storytelling.           This project was developed as part of the Year 7 Cambridge curriculum during            the current school year. Students were asked to write a story from a prompt             given in class, as part of a creative homework assignment. To make the task          more engaging, I organized a class-wide story writing competition—and Mewen's           outstanding effort earned him the winning title, thanks to his originality, detail,                                                    and artistic touch.             As his teacher, I wanted to celebrate his achievement in a meaningful way.                 That's why I created this ebook—to keep him engaged, motivated, and                             encouraged to continue exploring his creative abilities.            This book is dedicated to young readers everywhere, proving that great stories           can come from anyone, at any age. Mewen's work is not just a story—it is a                                piece of art, filled with passion and imagination.                  Enjoy the journey through the pages of this wonderful creation!
