Covering the            themes of Living Things and Sport Aim, Mewen's work showcases not only his                               imagination but also his dedication to storytelling.           This book is the result of a class competition I organized to inspire students to           express themselves through stories. Mewen's outstanding effort earned him the              winning title, and as his teacher, I wanted to celebrate his achievement in a               meaningful way. That's why I created this ebook—to keep him engaged,                         motivated, and encouraged to explore his creativity further.             This book is dedicated to young readers, proving that great stories can come          from anyone, at any age. Mewen's work is not just a story; it is a piece of art,                                          filled with passion and originality.

But the Jungle looks like a giant maze!          So the friends split into two teams:           team 1: Mewen + Ibrahim.          team 2: Ahmed, Taher.           One team goes to the right, the other team to the left.                                          Ibrahim                                                                                                                              Taher         Mewen                                                                                                 Ahmed","On the team 1 side .....                    Mewen and Ibrahim are walking quietly, in the forest when suddenly,                Roooooooooooooaaaaaaar !               They hear a roar. A leopard is in front of the two friends.               Leopard : Hello, I'm leopard. I will let you pass only if you win the race.           Mewen : What race.?              Leopard : The race you have to do Vs me!             Ibrahim : Ok, let's do this!             Mewen : We must be careful Ibrahim. The leopard           is reputed to be the fasest animal on earth !             Ibrahim : Don't worry! We will win if we do           \\teamwork             Leopard : 3, 2, 1 Gooooooo....","The Leopard was very fast for Ibrahim. But Mewen and Ibrahim prepared            a plan before the start of the race. The leopard was running so fast that             they could hardly see its legs move.                Mewen : Now Ibrahim !!               Suddenly, Ibrahim went on Mewen's back to jump very high.","","Yeah ! I won .... We                     Wooooooooon !!!!                    Yeah... You did... Good!                                                                                                         You're free to go","Team 2 Adventure ....                            Taher and Ahmed were walking quietly in the forest ( like Mewen and                Ibrahim). Then a snake came and proposed to Taher and Ahmed to go on                 a football match, so they can leave ....","Ahmed: A snake playing football ? hahahahahaha...            Taher \& Snake ( at the same moment ) : I don't understand what's           funny about this ?           Ahmed : You are a snake, you don't have legs to play !                                                                     Snake : I play with my tail...Huh let's play !","The football match started. The            snake was a very good player.               Snake: The first one who scores a          goal, wins the match !              While playing Ahmed was about to kick           the ball to score, but suddenly the          snake just wrapped its tail around the           ball...           Ahmed : You are cheating !             Snake: No ... No ...!!!             The snake was in front of Ahmed's           cage. He threw the ball but the boy           caught it well ...              Few minutes later, Ahmed had           his chance to score... and that's how he          made it out ...","","Meanwhile, Taher was fighting a monkey in a volleyball match.           Like the snake the monkey was using his tail to kick and hold the ball.              the monkey. was better in defense than in attack....                    8 minutes later, Taher won the match,           when he scored over the monkey.","Back to team 1....                Mewen \& ibrahim continued walking and then...               a Big Big gorilla king was there with his boxing gloves.             Gorilla King : Hey, little tiny kids ! Where are           you going like this ?           If you want to go, then you have to fight me!           If you win both can pass ... But If I win .........                                            Mewen: Okay ! Let's do this !","The gorilla was very strong but Mewen hit him twice on his legs and the          gorilla fell on the ground.             Gorilla King : Fiiiiine ! Enough You win ... You can go ....             Mewen \& Ibrahim : Okay , Bye !                30 minutes later, the boys met up and went home.             In the evening they told their family everything, about the animals they           met, the matches they had, the fun and the stress they went through ...                                                      The End","","Now it;s your turn,                                                        Do you think you'll                                                        win?
